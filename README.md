## Abstract

Urban living benefits greatly from weather forecast- ing since it may lower weather-related losses, safeguard public health and safety and promote both economic growth also quality of life. The main goal of this work is to develop a small-scale temperature forecasting system employing a cutting-edge time series model. In order to do so, data on Ho Chi Minh Cityâ€™s temperature is gathered. The performance of several time series models based on machine learning and deep learning is then evaluated for input data of various lengths. To create a small- scale temperature forecasting system, the best model is chosen. The suggested approach is particularly well suited for a smart agricultural indoor temperature forecasting system, which cannot be accomplished with any large-scale temperature forecasting systems.
